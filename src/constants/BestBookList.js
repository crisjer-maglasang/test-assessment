    linkTitle: "Shadow Warrior series",
    description: `The title alone alludes to the action in the book, but our heroine Abby is only beginning to understand her true warrior self. And coming to terms with that takes heart, as well as strength of character. \\ This book is a lively Beowulf-inspired adventure mixed with light-hearted humor and suspenseful cliffhanger action. Abby is trying to save her dad's life, so the stakes couldn't be much higher of her. But she's also figuring out her place in the world without a mother. Learning her heritage and the power that runs in her veins is Abby's true quest.\\The monsters certainly help coax her toward that goal, which makes this a terrific action-packed middle-grade book with heart`,

    title: "Journey Beyond the Burrow",
    author: "Rina Heiset",
    description: `Do not be fooled by the cuddly creatures on the beautiful cover! This book is full of harrowing adventure, creepy tension, and frightening woodland creatures like giant spiders and deadly snakes. At least, as seen from the perspective of our main character, Tobin the mouse. \\ Tobin's quest is full of heart, for he has taken it upon himself to save his younger brother from the clutch of the invading spiders who stole him to a faraway lair. Their adventure reminded of Secret of Nimh or The Lord of the Rings in that we follow a reluctant hero who rises to the occasion and shows their true self over the course of a challenging adventure.\\This is a terrific middle-grade action-adventure story bulging with heart.`,

      "Logan Foster is a character who will stick with you. His story is an exciting edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that belongs in the halls of great comic-book-level adventure. \\ And it is also an emotional journey for young Logan, who is seeking a family wondering about his lost sibling, and looking to find a place in the world. His world just happens to be extraordinary in many action-packed ways. \\ This book is laugh-out-loud funny and yes, sometimes dad-joke groan-worthy too. Because of its combination of excitement and heart, this book has earned a well-deserved spot on this list",

    description:
      "I think of this book like I do the stories that tell of how the constellations were born, That is, it epic legendary, and mythical, with a focus on Mexican and Mesoamerican lore. \\ Cece Rios has heart-she's trying to save her sister, after all-and strength of character, and she's extremely brave to go willingly to the creature fights to stake her own creature against the might of the fantastical beasts pitted against one another. But she has to do it if she's to win a chance at freeing her sister from El Sombreron. \\ With a sequel in the works, this series is sure to gain a following. And I'm one of them!",

    author: "Refe Tuma",
    description:
      "A visual and cinematic adventure that sweeps you through a pre WW2 version of Switzerland, this Frankenstein-inspired story is jam-packed with action and humor. \\ The primary characters are all idiosyncratic in a memorable way-Frances, who lost an ear in a car crash; Fritz, the monkey juiced up on intelligence serum; and Hobbes, the android tutor. Even the secondary characters are crafted with heart and colorfully distinct in their own respects. \\ The cliff-hangers and twists pushed the action along and I'm sure this will be a story kids read late into the night warning to find out what happens next. I received an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest opinion",

    "I love to read a good action-adventure story. I've also written a few. And I know that no matter how high the stakes, if there's no heart in the characters then there's very little engagement to make it any more memorable than a temporary thrill. I love thrills, but the stories that stick with you after the excitement of the moment is over, those are the true gems. Besides the fun of reading that type of book, maybe you even learn something about yourself or the world and come out a wee bit wiser than when you went in. And isn't that a fantastic use of our imaginative powers?!",
